# bamazon

A Node.js & MySQL digital storefront. This is a command line Node app that mimics a beloved online retailer.

I created a BamazonCustomer.js that receives orders from customers via the command line and interfaces with mySQL to deplete stock from the store's inventory.  

 INSTRUCTIONS:
 
 1.  Create a MySQL Database called bamazon.

 2.  Then create a table inside of that database called products.

 3.  The products table should have each of the following columns:
     * item_id (unique id for each product)
     * product_name (Name of the product)
     * department_name
     * price (cost to customer)
     * stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in the store)

 4.  Populate this database with around 10 different products (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).
