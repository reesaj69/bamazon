# bamazon

A Node.js & MySQL digital storefront. This is a command line Node app that mimics a beloved online retailer.

I created a BamazonCustomer.js that receives orders from customers via the command line and interfaces with mySQL to deplete stock from the store's inventory.  

 INSTRUCTIONS:
 
 1.  Create a MySQL Database called bamazon.

 2.  Then create a table inside of that database called products.
